# End-to-End Customer Purchase Analysis Project
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive end-to-end customer purchase analysis to understand customer behavior and purchase trends. The objective was to analyze and visualize key insights that would drive business decision-making. The project was executed in three phases using SQL, Python, and Power BI:

# Database Setup and Data Transformation (SQL):
I began by designing and setting up a relational database to store customer purchase data. Using SQL, I performed various data transformation tasks such as cleaning, normalizing, and joining tables to prepare the data for analysis. This step ensured the data was structured and optimized for subsequent extraction and processing.

# Data Extraction and Trend Analysis (Python):
Next, I utilized Python to extract data from the SQL database. Using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and pymysql I performed in-depth analysis to uncover customer behavior patterns and trends, such as purchase frequency, customer segmentation, and product preferences. I also used Python's visualization libraries, like Matplotlib and Seaborn, to validate initial insights before the dashboard creation.

# Visualization and Dashboard Creation (Power BI):
Finally, I used Power BI to build an interactive dashboard that displayed the discovered insights. The dashboard included key metrics such as sales by customer segment, popular products, and purchasing trends over time. This visual representation allowed stakeholders to explore the data, identify key drivers of customer behavior, and make informed decisions based on the insights.

This project successfully provided actionable insights into customer purchasing trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for business strategies.
